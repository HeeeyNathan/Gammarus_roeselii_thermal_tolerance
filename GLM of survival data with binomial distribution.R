# Hardin & Hilde 2018 (4th ed.) - Clog-log and log-log links are asymmetrically sigmoidal. 
# For clog-log models, the upper part of the sigmoid is more elongated or stretched out than 
# the logit or probit. Log-log models are based on the converse. The bottom of the sigmoid is
# elongated or skewed to the left.

# The clog-log inverse link function, which defines the fitted value for the model,
# is also used to predict the probability of death in data that are otherwise modeled
# using Cox proportional hazards models. In a Cox model, given that death is the
# failure event, the probability of death given predictors is a function of time.
# However, if we interpret the data only as those observations having reached the
# end point (death in this example) by a specific time, then we can estimate the
# likelihood of death by that specific time given the various predictors in the
# model as Pr(death) = 1 - exp{-exp(xÃŸ)}. One can thus use the log-log inverse link 
# to predict the probability of survival over the same time period.

# There is good reason to suspect that the log-log model is preferable to other binomial links.
# Modeling the grouped data with the log-log link assumes that the data have
# significantly more zeros than ones in the binary form. Accordingly, the resulting
# log-log model should have a lower deviance statistic than that of other links.
